# Advanced Library Management Application
This is an advanced library management system application which will allow you to manage advance library management operations like adding new books, replacing old books, changing the availability status etc. for library managers & and searching books, filtering books by category, viewing book status and as per the status issue the book for a definite period.

Technology I'm going to use here: (As per the planning)
Mostly the project will be based on Dot Net Core MVC with C# and for a few cases which need client-side rendering for better SEO management & and UI interaction but less backend calculation, I'm going to use React JS for the frontend with Web API. So, this project is going to be a hybrid project. For user authentication, I'm going to use the JWT token. Rest will update soon!

# What is done?
1. Created a base CRUD structure for the application which allows you to perform add/edit/delete books operations with Dot Net Core MVC.

# Whats I'm working on?
1. Working on the LogIn/Sign up page for managers & members based on the Dot net core WebAPI with JWT for authentication part.
2. Connect the LogIn/SignUp part (webapi) with the library management part (MVC) through API.
